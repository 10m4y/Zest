Zest is an innovative platform that combines a blockchain-based NFT marketplace for in-game skins with an immersive open-world game. Players can buy, sell, and trade unique skins as NFTs, which can be used in the game environment.

## Project Overview

Zest consists of three main components:

1. **Smart Contracts**: Manage the creation, ownership, and trading of skin NFTs.
2. **Frontend Marketplace**: A Next.js application for listing, buying, and selling skins.
3. **Open World Game**: A Three.js-based game where players can use their NFT skins and discover new ones.

## Smart Contracts

The project uses three main Solidity contracts:

1. `MultiSkins.sol`: An ERC721 contract for minting and managing skin NFTs.
2. `Queue.sol`: A helper contract for managing seller queues.
3. `Exchange.sol`: Handles the listing and trading of skin NFTs.

Key features:
- Mint different types of skin NFTs
- List skins for sale
- Buy skins from other players
- Check availability of skins

## Marketplace

The frontend marketplace is built with Next.js and provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with the smart contracts. It's located in the `marketplace` folder and includes features such as:

- Skin listings with visual previews
- Buy and sell functionality
- Wallet connection (MetaMask integration)
- User inventory management

## Game

The open-world game is built using Three.js and features:

- Minecraft-inspired UI
- Open world exploration
- Crates containing discoverable skins
- Integration with owned NFT skins
